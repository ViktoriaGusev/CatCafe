		<h3> Me: </h3>
		<img style="width:700px" src="catcafepics/me3.jpg" />
		<p>
		Hey my name is Vika and I'm the owner of the place.
		<br>I'm 28 years old, from Rishon Lezion.
		<br>I decided to open this Cat Cafe because I love cats and coffee!
		<br>I've been to a few Cat Cafes in europe and I loved the concept.
		<br>To be able to save some cats from the streets and let them live here,
		<br>feed them and let them be pet by so many people who are cat lovers!
		<br>Plus the costumers can enjoy their coffee while they have a purring cat on the lap.
		<br>So if you want to visit us you should meet our cats.
		<br>Here are some of them:
		</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3 > Ekler: </h3>
		<img style="width:700px" src="catcafepics/ekler.jpg" />
		<p>
		Ekler is only 10 months old and like all the kids - a bit crazy!
		<br>We found her in a garage of my old workplace.
		<br>She was only 3 months old and people fed her but not enough at all.
		<br>I instantly fell in love with her and decided to take her here.
		<br>She's so playful and sometimes you will get a bite just because she wanted to.
		<br>But despite her craziness she likes pets and purr and lay on your lap.
		<br>Try to play with her and you will enjoy your time!
		</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3> Niki:</h3>
		<img style="width:700px" src="catcafepics/niki.jpg" />
		<p>
		Niki is 3 years old and we found her in a trip to the Dead Sea.
		<br>I saw a 2 months old ginger kitten in the heat of Dead Sea area in the summer.
		<br>I just couldn't leave her there to suffer from the heat.
		<br>At first I tried to find her a new home.
		<br>But after a week I fell in love with her and couldn't let anyone take her.
		<br>Niki is VERY cute. Loves cuddles. Loves talking a lot!
		<br>But don't you dare to touch her if she doesn't want to be touched.
		<br>You can let her smell your hands and if you see a bit resistence - Don't touch!
		<br>Try talking to her, she will meow at you.
		</p>
		
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3> Lesia:</h3>
		<img style="width:700px" src="catcafepics/lesia.jpg" />
		<p>
		Lesia is our oldest, 4 years old.
		<br>We found her in a box near a dumpster and she was around 1-2 weeks old.
		<br>I was a bit scared to lose her because she was basically a newborn.
		<br>After a while she got bigger and stronger and she stayed with us.
		<br>She's very scared of... everything.
		<br>Better not move too much or do noises around her because she will be afraid.
		<br>She loves cuddles and pets and kisses but she doesn't like other cats.
		<br>Try to communicate with her, she might run away or love you lots.
